## üìò About

**Minishell** is a simplified shell project, built in C, that mimics core features of `bash`. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of:
- Process creation & management  
- File descriptors  
- Shell parsing & execution  

It's part of the curriculum at **42**, designed to teach you how the internals of a Unix shell work.

## üß© Shell Features

- Custom interactive prompt
- Command history (via `readline`)
- Execution of binaries via `PATH` or absolute/relative paths
- Environment variable handling (`$VAR`, `$?`)
- Input/output redirection (`<`, `>`, `>>`)
- Pipelines (`|`)
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`
- Built-in commands:
  - `echo` (with `-n`)
  - `cd`
  - `pwd`
  - `export`
  - `unset`
  - `env`
  - `exit`
- Proper signal handling:
  - `Ctrl-C` ‚Üí interrupts current command
  - `Ctrl-D` ‚Üí exits the shell
  - `Ctrl-\` ‚Üí ignored or handled appropriately
- Wildcard expansion (`*`) in the current directory
- Syntax support for parentheses to manage operator precedence

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### üß© Overview  
Minishell parses and executes commands using a structured approach involving **recursive descent parsing** and a **command execution tree**. This method enables efficient parsing and execution of even complex command sequences like pipelines, redirections, and logical operators.

---

### üß± Parsing with Recursive Descent

#### üîπ Lexical Analysis / Tokenization  
The first step involves breaking the input command string into **tokens** ‚Äî keywords, operators, arguments, and more.  
Tokens are typically identified using a **tokenizer**, which recognizes elements like:
- Commands (e.g. `ls`)
- Arguments (e.g. `-l`)
- Operators (`|`, `>`, `&&`, etc.)
- Redirection symbols
- Quotes and subshells

#### üîπ Recursive Descent Parsing  
This technique is a **top-down parsing** method where each grammar rule is represented by a function in the parser.  
Each parser function may call other functions recursively to process nested or dependent components.

The grammar defines the structure of valid shell input ‚Äî including how sequences of commands, pipelines, and redirections must be formed.  
This allows support for nested constructs like:

```bash
(cmd1 && cmd2) || cmd3 | cmd4 > file
```

#### üîπ Syntax Tree Construction  
As the parser processes the tokens, it builds a **syntax tree** (also known as an **abstract syntax tree** or AST).  
Each node represents:
- A command or argument
- A redirection
- A logical operator (`&&`, `||`)
- A pipe (`|`)

For example, a pipe operator creates a node with **two child nodes**, one for each command it connects.  
This tree represents the **logical structure** of the input and dictates the order of execution.

---

### üöÄ Command Execution

#### üîπ Tree Traversal  
Once the syntax tree is built, the shell enters the **execution phase**.  
It traverses the tree recursively ‚Äî the method of traversal depends on the type of node:
- **Simple command**: Execute directly
- **Pipe**: Connect two subcommands via pipe
- **Redirection**: Adjust file descriptors
- **Logical op**: Evaluate based on previous command's result

#### üîπ Command Expansion  
During traversal, expansions are performed:
- Replace `$VAR` with its value from the environment
- Expand `*` (wildcards) to match filenames in the current directory
- Replace special variables like `$?` (last command exit code)

#### üîπ Execution  

The execution follows a **bottom-up** approach:
- Leaf nodes (simple commands) are executed first
- Their outputs are passed through pipes or redirected as specified

Execution uses low-level system calls like:
- `fork()` ‚Äì to create child processes
- `execve()` ‚Äì to run external programs
- `dup2()` ‚Äì for I/O redirection
- `pipe()` ‚Äì to connect commands via pipes

#### üîπ Handling Built-ins vs External Commands  
- **Built-ins** (`cd`, `echo`, `export`, etc.) are executed **inside the shell process** (no `fork`)
- **External commands** (`ls`, `cat`, etc.) are executed in a **child process** using `execve()`

The shell must first **check** if a command is a built-in before deciding how to execute it.

#### üîπ Error Handling  
The shell implements robust (and maybe even a bit cheeky üòâ) error handling:
- Syntax errors (e.g., unmatched quotes, invalid operator usage)
- Command not found
- Invalid arguments or paths
- Permission denied
- Invalid redirections or file descriptor usage

Meaningful error messages are printed to help the user debug issues easily.

### üß™ Example Workflow

**Input:**  
```bash
ls -l | grep "test" > output.txt
```

**Tokens:**  
```text
[ls, -l, |, grep, "test", >, output.txt]
```

**Parsing:**  
- `ls -l` is parsed as a command node  
- `grep "test"` is parsed as another command node  
- `|` creates a pipe node with `ls -l` and `grep "test"` as children  
- `>` creates a redirection node parent to `grep "test"`  

**Tree Construction:**
```
       |   
      / \
    ls   >
          \
         grep "test"
              \
           output.txt
```

**Execution Steps:**
1. Execute `ls -l`
2. Pipe its output to `grep "test"`
3. Redirect the final result to `output.txt`

Each step is managed by traversing and interpreting the syntax tree, respecting the structure, order, and redirections implied by the parsed input.

---

**Note** 
Minishell was developed on a system running bash version 3.2.57, and it mimics its core features. 
As a result, some behaviors ‚Äî particularly the exit statuses of built-in commands ‚Äî may differ slightly from those in newer versions of Bash.
